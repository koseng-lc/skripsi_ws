I still looking for the time, to create the document for this project. But the basic idea summarized in the description below.

The main part of this architecture is divided by two part, high-level architecture and low-level architecture.

### High-Level
This part is responsible to handle all the motion of the humanoid. The resulting data are transmitted to Low-Level.

### Low-Level
All kinds of interaction between software and hardware are handled by this part,
such as receive data from sensor and transmit command to servo .

Compliant Joints*. In 13th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids), Atalanta, GA, 2013.

### Todos
  - Finishing Low-Level architecture
  - Solve the OpenGL simulation bug
